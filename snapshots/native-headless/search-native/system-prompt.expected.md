Use glob and grep for file discovery.

Use the glob tool — not shell find — to discover files by path pattern. A pattern with no "/" matches basenames at any depth, so "*" matches every file in the tree rather than its top level. Results are files only, never directories, and include hidden and ignored files: a result that fits comes back in modification-time order, while a larger one keeps the modification-time-ordered head.

Use the grep tool — not shell grep or rg — to search file contents.
