Report the restored scheduled root result.

Use workflow only when the user explicitly requests a workflow or large multi-agent orchestration. For one or two delegations, prefer subagent calls.

Use the ralph tool ONLY when the direct human explicitly asks for a Ralph loop or fresh-agent iterative execution. Each Ralph round starts a fresh child with no conversation seed and uses the shared workspace as durable memory. Completion and blockers are worker reports, not independent evaluation. Use same-session goal tools for ordinary long-running objectives, and plain subagents or workflows for bounded delegation and fan-out.
