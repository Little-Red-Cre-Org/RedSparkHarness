 * Cordis-free hook protocol for a Native bridge.

 * The matcher, codec, merge and detached-run modules are already framework
 * independent; this entry re-exports them together with a durable event helper
 * that takes the Native Session type, so a Native bridge never imports the
 * Cordis package root.
