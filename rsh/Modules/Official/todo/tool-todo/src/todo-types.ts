 * One entry in an agent's todo list — the unit of the `todo/write`
 * whole-list snapshot declared by this package.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal: a human-readable `content` line and a three-state
 * `status`. No id, priority, or `activeForm` — the list is replaced wholesale
 * on every write (last-write-wins), so entries need no stable identity. The
 * three statuses describe the complete portable lifecycle needed by model and
 * UI consumers.
