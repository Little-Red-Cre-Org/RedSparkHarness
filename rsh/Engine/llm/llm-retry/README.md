# @deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-retry

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Mount `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-retry` to retry failed model requests at durable agent-step boundaries. Provider `retryPolicy` settings choose bounded normal-mode retries or unlimited always-mode retries; scheduled attempts reach the session log before backoff, and cancellation leaves consistent history. Retries re-run the failed step in the same open turn, while direct `ctx.llm.stream()` calls remain single-attempt. The Cordis-free `./native` installer applies the same policy in every shipped native profile. Each retry is another billed provider request, and always mode continues until success, cancellation, or disposal.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin when agent runs should recover from transient model-request failures — rate limits, server errors, timeouts, transport errors — instead of ending the turn. It is the executor: the retry policy itself lives on each provider adapter's configuration, and this package has no configuration of its own.

### When to choose it

Choose it when a composition runs the agent loop and wants durable request recovery. The plugin is a function plugin with no config; provider adapters such as `dsh-llm-deepseek` and `dsh-llm-pi-ai` own the `retryPolicy` for their routes, and multi-provider adapters place it inside each provider profile. Skip it when calls go through `ctx.llm.stream()` directly without the agent loop: those consumers remain single-attempt because a raw stream cannot separate already-emitted chunks durably.

### Minimal configuration

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-deepseek'
  config:
    apiKeyEnv: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    retryPolicy:
      mode: always
      backoff:
        initialDelayMs: 1000
        maxDelayMs: 30000
        jitterRatio: 0.2

- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-retry'
```

Omission of `retryPolicy` uses normal mode: five retries for `EMPTY_RESPONSE`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `SERVER`, `TIMEOUT`, and `TRANSPORT`, with bounded exponential backoff from 500 ms to 10 seconds and 10 percent jitter. Normal mode can change its finite budget, eligible codes, and backoff; always mode asks downstream recovery first, then retries every model-request failure without an attempt limit, stopping only on success, cancellation, or plugin disposal.

### What you can observe

Each scheduled retry is durable before its wait: the plugin appends a non-surface `llm/retry` event carrying the retry id, provider, mode, policy key, failure, and scheduled delay, then a `llm/retry-started` event immediately before the retry begins. A valid `Retry-After` from the provider replaces local backoff when it fits the policy bounds. When the wait completes, the loop re-runs the failed step inside the same open turn over the same durable history, so the retried request is reconstructable from the session log exactly like the original. Cancellation or plugin disposal aborts active backoff, drains active delegated recovery, and makes a callback captured before disposal fail closed.

### Failures and recovery

A failure before any final adapter is selected has no provider policy and delegates downstream unchanged. In normal mode, a failure code outside the eligible set, or an exhausted budget, delegates; in always mode, an over-cap provider delay uses the configured local backoff so the policy cannot terminate on that instruction. Nothing here is model-visible: no retry event, delay, provider error, or failed partial output reaches the model or derived messages.

### Native profiles

The `./native` installer accepts no settings, requires the selected `modelExecution` service and registers one recovery policy. It writes the same `llm/retry` and `llm/retry-started` events, persists each before the wait, and uses the same eligibility, budget, delay and jitter rules. The provider policy comes from the selected model; a model that declares none gets the same normal default as the Cordis LLM runtime. Native model execution offers both a terminal error finish and an adapter that throws; when no policy retries a thrown failure, the turn keeps the original error. Each failed attempt is recorded as `assistant/attempt`, and live stream observers see the failed attempt's chunks before the retried attempt's chunks.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design behind the executor; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The executor is built on one rule: **durable before wait, open-step boundaries.** A retry is scheduled through the session log before any timer starts, so a crash or cancellation never leaves an invisible pending retry. Recovery runs on the agent loop's `agent/request-error` waterfall, the open-step extension point, rather than wrapping `ctx.llm.stream()` — a raw stream cannot separate already-emitted chunks durably, while the loop can re-run the failed step inside the same open turn.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | The function plugin: waterfall listener, policy lookup, backoff, durable event appends |
| [`src/history.ts`](src/history.ts) | Durable retry-history lookup from the session log |
| [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) | Browser-safe `llm/retry` and `llm/retry-started` event payload types |
| [`src/brand.ts`](src/brand.ts) | The `RetryId` brand shared by the event payloads |
| [`src/core.ts`](src/core.ts) | Runtime-neutral retry decision, delay calculation and cancellable wait shared by both entries |
| [`src/native.ts`](src/native.ts) | Native installer over `modelExecution.onRecovery` |

### Recovery flow

A failed step arrives on the waterfall with its provider and resolved policy. Always mode settles downstream recovery first and honors a downstream `retry` decision; normal mode first checks that the failure code is eligible and the budget is not exhausted. The plugin computes the delay — provider `Retry-After` when valid and within bounds, otherwise local bounded exponential backoff with symmetric jitter — appends the `llm/retry` event, waits on a cancellable timer, appends `llm/retry-started`, and returns `{ kind: 'retry' }`. The loop then re-runs the failed step inside the same open turn over the same durable history.

### Native recovery

[`src/native.ts`](src/native.ts) runs the same `recoverWithRetry` algorithm from [`src/core.ts`](src/core.ts). Instead of the Cordis Session projection, it keeps retry history for the current turn and step of each Session in memory and clears it when a new step starts. Recovery policies registered later run first, and each delegates to the next at most once, matching the Cordis waterfall. Removing the installation aborts active waits and drains recovery that is already running.

### Waterfall composition

The plugin is one listener in the `agent/request-error` waterfall. Always mode's "downstream first" posture means a later policy that ignores cancellation and never settles also prevents fallback, turn quiescence, and plugin disposal from completing; success, cancellation, or disposal stops always mode after active delegated recovery reaches quiescence.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the package-level contract is not enough. They move from the service contract to the adapters that own retry policies.

- [dsh-llm service](../llm/README.md) — the provider-neutral service whose adapters own `retryPolicy`.
- [llm-deepseek adapter](../../../Modules/Official/llm/llm-deepseek/README.md) — a provider adapter with a route-level `retryPolicy`.
- [llm-pi-ai adapter](../../../Modules/Official/llm/llm-pi-ai/README.md) — a multi-provider adapter with per-profile `retryPolicy`.
- [Terminal LLM stream failures](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-terminal-llm-stream-failures.md) — how failures reach the service boundary as terminal chunks.

## Model Experience

### Model-request recovery

#### What the model sees

No retry event, delay, provider error, or failed partial output is model-visible. The retried step reconstructs the same explicit provider/model request from durable surface history unless a downstream recovery policy deliberately changes that surface; failed chunks never enter derived messages.

#### Token effect

Each retry is a new provider request and may repeat input-token billing. Normal mode has a finite budget; always mode can consume unbounded requests until success or cancellation. `llm/retry` itself contributes no tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

The reconstructed request preserves the prior prefix and is eligible for provider cache reuse under that provider's rules. The non-surface retry event does not change cache identity.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define where the executor stops and future work begins. They are current package constraints, not a general retry comparison or a task backlog.

- **Agent turns are the only retry boundary** — direct `ctx.llm.stream()` consumers remain single-attempt because a raw stream cannot separate already-emitted chunks durably.
- **Always mode retries permanent failures** — authentication, quota, invalid-request, protocol, and unrecoverable context errors continue until success, cancellation, or disposal; deployments own provider-specific cost and latency controls.
- **Finite plugin budgets add** — normal mode counts only its configured codes and exact provider policy, while context-overflow compaction owns a separate budget. Any overlapping policy must define registration-order behavior.
- **Recovery policies compose by waterfall order** — always mode accepts a downstream retry before applying its fallback. A later policy that ignores cancellation and never settles also prevents fallback, turn quiescence, and plugin disposal from completing.
- **`llm/retry` records scheduling, not completion** — later step and turn events establish success, exhaustion, or cancellation.
- **Native retry budgets restart after a restart** — the native installer keeps the current step's history in memory, so a Session resumed after a crash in the middle of a retry chain starts a new budget instead of reading earlier `llm/retry` events.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

This Dev Note is non-authoritative working context: notes for maintainers and open questions. Shipped behavior and accepted rationale live in the sections above, the package code, and the linked Agent Notes.

- Retry numbers continue only across events with the same provider and complete policy key, so a route replacement with different limits, code membership, or backoff starts its own history; the key includes every behavior-affecting field and sorts normal-mode codes because eligibility uses set membership.
- The separately published `./invariant` companion validates each scheduled retry against the session log — naming the current open turn and latest closed step, matching the failed request's durable provider, and requiring each `llm/retry-started` event to name one prior scheduled attempt with the same retry id, turn, step, and retry number.
