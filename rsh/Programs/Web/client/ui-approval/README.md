## Summary

Browser approval presentation over the Agent-scoped Remote Event waterfall. The plugin publishes each pending request through `ctx.uiSession`, takes over the Conversation composer, optionally renders correlated Tool detail, and returns the user's decision to the waiting Host request. Use it when a browser must collect approval for a waiting Host operation.

The `./native` entry exports the same approval card presentation through props and Host answer callbacks, without loading the legacy plugin entry.

## Model Experience

None, as this package presents approval requests in the browser and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; approval request and response rendering does not alter a model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Approval cards expose transient decisions only** — allow-once and reject are supported; the Native Host answer does not include a session-scoped allow outcome, and persistent permission policy remains owned by Host-side approval packages.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Registries own and observe the Remote listener and temporary Slot entry; `./native` is a props-only view entry.
