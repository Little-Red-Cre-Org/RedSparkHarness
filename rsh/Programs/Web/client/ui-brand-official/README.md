# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-brand-official

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package gives an `official` client build the RedSpark mark in the sidebar. The sidebar retains its localized RedSpark Harness name, and the conversation hero retains its own animation. Other build profiles keep the sidebar's default mark. It has no runtime state and does not affect model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster, then build the client with the `official` profile to register the RedSpark mark.

### Choosing the profile

`DSH_CLIENT_BUILD_PROFILE=official` enables the sidebar mark occupant. Other values leave the sidebar's default mark in place. This package does not occupy `sidebar.brand.name` or `conversation.hero.brand.mark`; their declaring packages own the localized name and hero presentation. The plugin loads in both cases; only registration is profile-gated.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with its own identity leaves this package out and composes another package that occupies the sidebar slots — and the hero slot, which this package leaves on its fallback. Occupying a slot is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The mark registers through `ctx.slots.inject()` after its sidebar declaration becomes available and withdraws when that declaration disappears. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts); the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** — alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** — `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The package retains no mutable state; its mark registration installs and leaves through the slot lifecycle.
